## playground C
For the legendary C tricks.

### Intro
Just like other playground I setup here, on github, the purpose is to understand and control the tricky parts of any language. In case of C/C++, it's mostly about controlling pointer & references, and obfuscated short-hand, especially C++.

### Progress 

1. Pointer Test \([pointer_test.cpp](https://github.com/thetrung/playground_c/blob/master/pointer_test.cpp)\)
- Cover pointer `*, &, *&`
- Change value via pointer
- Passing pointer -> function
- Passing pointer & change value inside function
- Passing pointers inside function, pointer to pointer

2. Bool Test \([bool_test.c](https://github.com/thetrung/playground_c/blob/master/bool_test.c)\)
- Test to ensure boolean return inside a class.
- Default return is `false` when unassign/uninit.
